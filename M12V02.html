<p>Our next step is to discuss concepts related to augmenting a matching because the algorithm we are going to describe starts with a matching and gradually augments it until it becomes a maximum matching.</p>
<p>So, let us talk about some related concepts here.</p>
<p>For the bipartite matching problem, there is actually an algorithm that utilizes the max flow algorithm.</p>
<p>We can map the bipartite matching problem to a network flow problem and utilize the network flow problem to find a maximum flow there, and the maximum flow there can be utilized to generate a maximum matching in the original bipartite graph so that the algorithm can find a maximum matching in time order of <em>VE</em>.</p>
<p>In this lecture, we are going to introduce a more efficient algorithm called the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. Its time complexity will be the order of the square root of <em>V</em> times <em>E</em>.</p>
<p>Let us define a few concepts first. We are going to talk about what is a maximum matching and what is a maximal matching. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size. In other words, it is a matching whose number of edges is maximized. Now, what is a maximal matching? A maximal matching is a matching <em>M</em>, a set of edges in the graph to which no other edges can be added.</p>
<p>And that is for every edge <em>E</em>, which is not in the matching we already have, in the matching <em>M</em> we already have. The edge set <em>M</em> union <em>E</em> fails to be a matching. In other words, maximal matching is basically matching whose size is locally optimized, locally maximized, in the following sense. Given this maximal matching <em>M</em>, which is a set of edges, we cannot add any edge to it because any other edge we add to it must share at least one vertex with some edge already in the matching.</p>
<p>Here is one example of this simple graph with two nodes on the left-hand side and two nodes on the right-hand side. The two red edges shown here form a maximum matching because that is the biggest size that we can find for a matching, which is two. But if we look at this matching here, which has only one edge from <em>b</em> to <em>u</em>, this is actually a maximum matching.</p>
<p>Because even though we know this matching is not... Of maximum size, we cannot add any edge to it. So, if we add this edge <em>au</em>, <em>au,</em> and <em>bu</em> share a common vertex <em>u</em>, it will not match anymore. Similarly, we cannot add edge bv to this matching <var>bu</var>. Therefore, this matching, which has only size 1, is already a maximum matching.</p>
<p>So, it is easy to see that a maximum matching is also a maximum matching. However, a maximum matching is not always a maximum matching. And we know that we can see that the maximum matching is basically globally optimal, and the maximum matching is only locally optimal.</p>
<p>The next concept we define is called the M-alternating path.</p>
<p>Here is the definition. Given a matching <em>M</em> in an undirected graph <em>G</em>, now remember a matching <em>M</em> is a set of edges, and given a matching <em>M</em> in an undirected graph <em>G</em>, an M-alternating path is a simple path whose edges alternate between being in <em>M</em> and not being in <em>M</em>. Basically, an <em>M</em> ordinate path is a set of edges which ordinates between being in <em>M</em> and not being in <em>M</em>.</p>
<p>So, in other words, being in M and being in <em>E</em>-<em>M</em>. Here is one example. For this graph on the left-hand side, we have a matching of size 4 here. Which are the blue edges from <var>l</var><sub>2</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>2</sub>, from <var>l</var><sub>3</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>3</sub>, from <var>l</var><sub>5</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>7</sub>, and from <var>l</var><sub>7</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>5</sub>. So, the four blue nodes on the left-hand side are matched to the four blue nodes on the right-hand side. These yellow nodes are not matched.</p>
<p>Now let us take a look at this red path here. This red path starts at <var>l</var><sub>6</sub>. From <var>l</var><sub>6</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>7</sub>, from <var>r</var><sub>7</sub> to <var>l</var><sub>5</sub>, from <var>l</var><sub>5</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>5</sub>, from <var>r</var><sub>5</sub> to <var>l</var><sub>7</sub>, and from <var>l</var><sub>7</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>8</sub>. So, this red path over here is alternating between edges that are not in a match and in a match.</p>
<p>Here, the first edge is not in a match because it is not blue. The second edge is actually a matching edge. The third edge is not a matching edge. The fourth edge is a matching edge. The fifth edge is not a matching edge. It ordinates between matching edges or not matching edges. So, such a path is called an N-ordinating path.</p>
<p>So here, again, <var>M</var> stands for this matching <var>M</var> we already have.</p>
<p>Now, let us define something called an M-augmenting path. An M-augmenting path is defined like this. An M-alternating path whose first and last vertices are not matched by <var>M</var>. In other words, an M-augmented path is an M-alternating path with a special property. If we look at the first node and last node in this path, they are unmatched nodes.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at our example here. In our example, The two endpoints of this path are <var>l</var><sub>6</sub> and <var>l</var><sub>8</sub>. So <var>l</var><sub>6</sub> is one endpoint of this red path, and <var>r</var><sub>8</sub> is another endpoint of this red path. And we can see that L6 is unmatched, and <var>r</var><sub>8</sub> is also unmatched. So, such an M-alternating path is called the M-augmenting path.</p>
<p>In other words, if we look at an M-augmented path, then it starts with an edge that is not a matching edge, followed by a matching edge, and then a not matching edge, then then a not matching edge, then a matching edge, and the last edge must also be an unmatching edge. In other words, if we look at the first edge and the last edge, the first and last edges in this red path must not be matching edges.</p>
<p>Before we show how to use M-augmenting paths to augment our match in a graph, let us define an operation called a symmetric difference. Here is the definition. Given two sets, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, their symmetric difference is defined to be the union of <em>X</em> minus <em>Y</em> and <em>Y</em> minus <em>X</em>.</p>
<p>Let us say the first circle here is a set <em>X,</em> and the second circle is a set <em>Y</em>. Then the part of the elements here is <em>X</em> minus <em>Y</em>, which are elements in <em>X</em> but not in <em>Y</em>. The part in that area is <em>Y</em> minus <em>X</em>, which are elements in <em>Y</em> but not in <em>X</em>. Basically, we take the elements in <em>X</em> but not in <em>Y</em> and the elements in <em>Y</em> but not in <em>X</em>, and their union is called the symmetric difference between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. Basically, these are the elements that are different for <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. It is either in <em>X</em> but not in <em>Y</em>, or in <em>Y</em> but not in <em>X</em>. It is a difference.</p>
<p>We can see that another way to write down this symmetric difference between <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> is simply to take the union of <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> and then take away the intersection part. So it is <em>X</em> union <em>Y</em> minus <em>X</em> intersect <em>Y,</em> and that will also give us the symmetric difference.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the operator, the symmetric difference here, is commutative and associative because the symmetric difference between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> is equal to the symmetric difference between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> based on this symmetric definition.</p>
<p>Also, the symmetric difference between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, then we take the symmetric difference with <em>Z</em>, is the same as first taking the symmetric difference between <var>X</var>, <em>Y</em>, and <em>Z</em> and then taking the symmetric difference with x. So, it is commutative and associative. Furthermore, if we take the symmetric difference between <em>X</em> and <em>X</em>, then we get the empty set.</p>
<p>If we compute the symmetric difference between <em>X</em> and an empty set or the symmetric difference between an empty set and <em>X</em>, then we still get the set <em>X</em>. So, these are just the basic differences, the basic properties for this symmetric difference operation.</p>
<p>Now, let us have a lemma. The lemma says, Let <em>M</em> be a matching in any undirected graph <em>G</em>.</p>
<p>So <em>M</em> is any matching, a set of edges, in the undirected graph <em>G</em> under the <em>P</em> M-augmenting path. So, <em>P</em> is an M-augmenting path. Then, if we look at a set of edges, <em>M</em>', which equals the symmetric difference between <em>M</em> and a <em>P</em>, then <em>M</em>' is also a matching <em>G</em>, and the size of <em>M</em>' is the size of <em>M</em> + 1.</p>
<p>Here is one example. For the first graph on the left-hand side, we have a matching called <em>M</em> in this particular example, and the matching has size four. We have four blue edges. Now, in the middle, we show a m augmenting path, which is this red path over here. So this red path is our path <em>P</em>.</p>
<p>Now, what is the symmetry difference between <em>M</em> and <em>P</em>? Let us see. Let us look at the edges, the blue edge, and red edge over here. Because blue edges are the edges in <em>M</em>, and the red edges are the edges in path <em>P</em>. So, since we are taking the symmetric difference, if we have a red edge along with a blue edge between two nodes, then both of them will disappear in the symmetric difference.</p>
<p>Because in a symmetric difference, we are talking about the edges that are in <em>M</em> but not in <em>P</em>. Or in <em>P</em>, but not in <em>M</em>. So, if this edge appears in both <em>M</em> and <em>P</em>, then it will disappear in a symmetric difference. Therefore, this edge <em>l</em>7 to <em>r</em>5 will disappear, and this edge <em>l</em>5 to <em>r</em>7 will also disappear.</p>
<p>So, if we take away these two edges, which appear in both <em>M</em> and <em>P</em>, then these are the edges that remain. So, we can see that these edges that remain actually form a matching. And if we look at the size here, it becomes five, which is one more than before. This is correct, which validates what the lemma is saying.</p>
<p>Now the question is, why is what the lemma is saying true in general?</p>
<p>Well, let us take a look. Let us consider this path <var>P</var> here. The path <var>P</var> here is an M-augmenting path. And we know that the edges actually are alternating between non-matching edges and matching edges. And because it is an M-augmenting path, by definition, the first node is unmatched, and so the first edge is not a matching edge.</p>
<p>So, the first edge is not a matching edge. The second edge is a matching edge. The third edge is not a matching edge. The fourth edge is again a matching edge, and so on, until we end at a non-matching edge. So, we can see that this path must have an odd number of edges. In this path, <var>P</var>, the number of non-matching edges must be equal to the number of matching edges plus 1.</p>
<p>So <var>P</var> has in all the number of edges, and the number of edges in <var>P</var> which are not in a matching is 1 more than the number of edges which are in a matching. Therefore, when we take the symmetric difference here. So, all those edges that are in the matching <var>M</var> will disappear.</p>
<p>All those edges that are not in the matching will remain. And the number of edges that remain, which are added to this, basically, to this matching we have here, is one more than the number of edges we take away. As a result, the number of edges we have in the remaining will be one more than before.</p>
<p>Basically, we showed <var>M</var> + 1. Now, how can we show that these <var>M</var> + 1 edges here must form a matching? That is because if we look at the original green edges here in the original matching, they do not touch each other. So, they do not share any common vertex. Also, for this red path over here, the first node and the last node are also unmatched nodes.</p>
<p>So, these nodes here also do not touch any of the remaining blue edges. Therefore, if we look at the final matching for those blue edges, which do not touch the red path, they still remain as they are. And for those edges on this red path <var>P</var>, we keep some of them and get rid of some others of them.</p>
<p>Basically, the edges we keep are the edges. We only have the red here. We do not have the blue here. And the edges we got rid of are the places where we both have the blue and the red edges over here. Because they alternate, these edges that have remained here also do not share any common vertex.</p>
<p>This is why the blue edge we have in the end will be a new matching, and this new matching size is one more than before. So, this lemma tells us that if we have a matching, and we can find an M-augmenting path by taking the symmetric difference between the original matching and this M-augmenting path, we can get a new matching whose size is one more than before, so we can get a bigger matching.</p>
<p>Because of the lemma that we just proved, we can have a corollary here. Let <var>M</var> be a matching in any undirected graph <var>G</var> and let <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>P</var><sub>2,</sub> all the way to <var>P<sub>k</sub></var> be vertex disjoint M-augmenting paths, and then a set of edges called <var>M</var>', which is defined to be the difference between <var>M</var> and the <var>P</var><sub>1</sub> union, <var>P</var><sub>2</sub> union, all the way to union <var>P<sub>k</sub></var>, is also a matching in <var>G</var> and the size of the new matching <var>M</var>' will be <var>M</var> + <var>k</var>.</p>
<p>Let us see how to prove this corollary here. Since <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>P</var><sub>2</sub>, or the <var>P<sub>k</sub></var> are vertex disjoint, then the union of <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>P</var><sub>2</sub>, or the <var>P<sub>k</sub></var> are simply the symmetric difference between <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>P</var><sub>2</sub>, or the <var>P<sub>k</sub></var> because <var>k</var> sets here are disjoint. Then, the symmetric difference is just a union of them.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we take the symmetric difference between <var>M</var> and this union, then the same as taking the symmetric difference between <var>M</var>, and in the bracket, we have the symmetric difference between <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>P</var><sub>2</sub>, all the way to <var>P<sub>k</sub></var>.</p>
<p>Because this symmetric difference operation is associative, it is equal to the following operation. We first take the symmetric difference between <var>M</var> and <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>, and then, with a symmetric difference with <var>P</var><sub>2</sub>, and then, with a symmetric difference with <var>P</var><sub>3,</sub> and so on, until we come to <var>P</var><sub>k</sub>. So, each time, we can just take one more M-augmenting path we have here and use it to augment the original path.</p>
<p>Original matching. So, and by the lemma we have proved, the result will still be a matching. And what will be the size? Well, when we use one M-augmenting path to augment, the matching size will increase by 1. And after we do it, we get a new matching with size one more than before. And because these M-augmenting paths are vertex disjoint.</p>
<p>So, we can still apply the lemma to the next M-augmenting path and then to the next one. So, each time we add one more M-augumenting path to the matching we already have, the size will increase by 1. So after <var>k</var> augmentations, we get a new matching of size, which is <var>k</var> more than before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let us have a lemma here. The lemma says, let <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>' match in graph <var>G</var> and consider graph <var>G</var>', where this graph <var>G</var>' still has the same vertices as before, but a new set of edges and the set of edges is simply the symmetric difference between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*. So, here, an <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>* are two matchings or two sets of edges.</p>
<p>Let us take the submission difference between two sets of edges. The two match and the result is the set of edges in this graph called a <var>G</var>'. So there we have the following conclusions. We claim that <var>G</var>' is a disjoint union of simple paths, simple cycles, and or isolated vertices. Basically, <var>G</var>' will be a set of simple paths, simple cycles, and isolated vertices.</p>
<p>And these paths or edges or cycles or vertices do not share any common vertex. Another conclusion is that the edges in each such simple path or simple cycle alternate between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*. So, if we look at any simple path or simple cycle here, the edges in the side path or cycle will be alternating between the matching <var>M</var> and the other matching <var>M</var>*.</p>
<p>Another conclusion is that if <var>M</var>*, its size is more than <var>M</var>, then <var>G</var>' contains at least <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var> vertex disjoint, M-augmenting paths. Basically, here we are given a lower bound on how many <var>M</var> or commuting paths there must be. If we can have another matching <var>M</var>* whose size is bigger than <var>M</var>.</p>
<p>Let us see why this lemma is true. First of all, let us examine some examples.</p>
<p>Let us say that we have this graph on the left-hand side, which shows this matching <var>M</var>. So, here, <var>M</var> has four edges. As for these four blue edges. And let us say that we have another matching in the same graph, which is <var>M</var>*.</p>
<p>And the <var>M</var>* here has 1 red edge and 5 red edges. So, now let us take the symmetric difference between the two matchings. So, let us take the symmetric difference between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*. So, let us first combine <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*. If we just combine, take the union of <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*, and these are all the blue edges we have in <var>M</var>&nbsp;and all the red edges in <var>M</var>*.</p>
<p>Of course, the two sets here share some common edge. For example, we look at the edge here between <var>l</var><sub>7</sub> and <var>r</var><sub>5</sub>. This is an edge both in <var>M</var> and in <var>M</var>*. So, since we are taking a symmetric difference, this edge should disappear. Therefore, let us take it away.</p>
<p>The result is the symmetric difference between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*.</p>
<p>As we can see, indeed, here we have a cycle here, and also we have a path over here. The cycle here and the path here do not share any common vertex. Therefore, the first claim seems to be true. <var>G</var>' is a disjoint union of simple paths, simple cycles, and or isolated vertices. Now, in this example, we do not see any isolated vertex.</p>
<p>But in general, they could exist.</p>
<p>Also, the second conclusion is that the edges in each such simple path or simple cycle alternate between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*, and that is also true for this example. Let us take a look at the cycle above. The cycle has a blue edge, then a red edge, and a blue edge, then a red edge.</p>
<p>And the blue edges belong to <var>M</var>, and the red edges belong to <var>M</var>*. So, we can see the cycle is ordinating between edges in <var>M</var> and edges in <var>M</var>*. Also, let us take a look at the, take a look at this path at the bottom here. It has a red edge, a blue edge, and a red edge. Again, the edges in this path are alternating between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*.</p>
<p>Let us look at another conclusion here. If <var>M</var>* size is more than <var>M</var> size, then this graph <var>G</var>' here contains at least <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var> where it has disjoint <var>M</var> of minimum size. Let us take a look here. The size of <var>M</var> here is 4. We have 4 blue edges. And the size of <var>M</var>* is 4, 5 red edges. Therefore, in this example, the size of <var>M</var>* is indeed more than the size of <var>M</var>.</p>
<p>Actually, by 1. And the conclusion says that there should be at least one M-augmenting pass here. And indeed, we have this one. So, this is an M-augmenting pass. We have one such path. Let us see if we add this path to the original matching <var>M</var>&nbsp;and what it looks like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we can see we copy the path here.</p>
<p>So, it is <var>r</var><sub>4</sub> to <var>l</var><sub>5</sub>, <var>l</var><sub>5</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>7</sub>, <var>r</var><sub>7</sub> to <var>L</var><sub>6</sub>. So here is <var>R</var><sub>4</sub> to <var>l</var><sub>5</sub>, <var>l</var><sub>5</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>7</sub>, <var>r</var><sub>7</sub> to <var>l</var><sub>6</sub>. We can see that this is indeed an M-augmenting path.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at another example. In this example, we have a matching size matching <var>M</var> of size four. And here we have a new matching <var>M</var> Pro <var>M</var>*, which has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 6 edges. Let us first combine the blue edges in the <var>M</var> and the red edges in <var>M</var>* and see what they look like.</p>
<p>So, this is the union of these two sets of edges. Now we can see that between some node pairs, the edge exists in both <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>* like this one, <var>l</var><sub>3</sub> to <var>r</var><sub>3</sub>. This edge is both blue and red. So, it is shared by the two matching. Therefore, when we compute the symmetric difference, this edge will disappear.</p>
<p>Similarly, the edge between <var>l</var><sub>7</sub> and <var>r</var><sub>5</sub> exists in both matching most matchings. So, it will disappear when we compute the symmetric difference.</p>
<p>So, let us take away these two edges, and we get the real symmetric difference between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*. Again, we can see, in this case, that it is a union of simple cycles, simple paths, vertices, or isolated vertices.</p>
<p>In particular, here, basically, we have two simple paths. And by this last conclusion here, there should be at least an <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var>. A vertex is joined, an M-augmenting path. And here, <var>M</var>* equals 6, and <var>M</var> equals 4. So 6 minus 4 is 2. Therefore, we should have two M-augumenting paths. And indeed, here we have two.</p>
<p>One is the one on the top, which is an M-augumenting path. And the other one is the one at the bottom here, which is also an M-augmenting path.</p>
<p>If we add the M-augmenting path back to the original set <var>M</var>, then this is what it looks like.</p>
<p>So, these are two examples of this lemma. And now, let us try to prove why this is true. Let us make an observation here. The <var>M</var> is just a set of edges that are disjoint, a vertex disjoint. And <var>M</var>* is also a set of edges which are disjoint. So, if we take, if we combine them, if we combine them, then every node will have a degree of either 0 or 1 or 2.</p>
<p>Why? Because in the original matching <var>M</var>, every node has a degree at most 1. And in <var>M</var>*, every node has degree 1. So if we combine them, every node's degree will be at most 2. And if we think about a graph where every node's degree is at most 2, Then there are only three possible structures in it.</p>
<p>One is that we have a cycle. One is that we have a path. Or, we have an isolated node. And this is why the first conclusion here is true. <var>G</var>' must be a unit of a simple path. Simple cycles and or isolated vertices, and they are all disjoint from each other.</p>
<p>So, this is true.</p>
<p>Now, why is the second conclusion true?</p>
<p>Why is it true that the edges in each <em>M</em>* simple path or simple cycle must be alternating between <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>*? This is also quite simple because every node has a degree, at most, one in the original matching. Therefore, If we think about a cycle they form, then let us say that if this edge is a blue edge, which belongs to <var>M</var>, then the next edge has to be a red edge because we cannot have a blue edge over here.</p>
<p>If we have a blue edge over here, then this will not be a match anymore. Therefore, it must be alternating between red and blue edges. Similarly, for each path, the same conclusion holds.</p>
<p>Now, why is it that if the size of <var>M</var>* is more than <var>M</var>, then there must be at least <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var> vertices disjoint M-augmenting paths?</p>
<p>Let us take a look. First of all, let us take a look at the paths. We see that this path must be an M-augmenting path because, by the second conclusion, the edges in it are alternating between red and blue edges. When we look at this M-ordinating path, the edges are ordinated between red and blue edges if we count the number of red edges minus the number of blue edges.</p>
<p>This difference is, at most, one because the idea starts, say, because the maximum difference happens when we start with a red edge and end with a red edge. And even in that case, the number of red edges minus the number of blue edges in such a path is at most one. And if we look at a cycle here, in a cycle, the number of blue edges equals the number of red edges.</p>
<p>So, the cycle will not give us any difference between the number of blue edges and the number of red edges. And as for paths, every path will give us, at most, a difference by one. The number of red edges can be more than the number of blue edges by one. But here, we have a total gap of <em>M</em>* minus <em>M</em>. So there are total <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var>, this many.</p>
<p>Basically, the number of red edges is more than the number of blue edges. by <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var>. Therefore, we will need at least <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var> such M-alternating paths where it starts with a red edge and ends with a red edge to meet this gap of <var>M</var>* minus <var>M,</var> which is different between the total number of red edges minus the total number of blue edges.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have at least <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var> M-alternating paths, which start with a red edge and end with a blue edge. And such a path is an M-augmenting path. So we have at least <var>M</var>, <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var>, vertex disjoint, and M-augmenting paths. And that is the final conclusion in this lemma.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at the conclusion we have so far and see what they mean here. So, by the first result we get here, which is, let <em>M</em> be a matching in any undirected graph <var>G</var>, And, if we have <em><var>k</var></em> vertex-disjoint M-augmented paths, then by taking the similar difference between the two, we can find a matching of size <var>k</var> more than before.</p>
<p>So this conclusion shows that if there is a non-optimal matching, and if there exist M-augmented paths, then we can use these M-augmented paths to augment the matching to a larger size. So, it means that if our matching is not optimal yet and is not our maximum size yet if we are able to find augmented paths, then we can utilize these augmented paths to find even bigger matching.</p>
<p>We can do that. The second result we have here is to let <var>M</var> and <var>M</var>* be matching in graph <var>G</var>. And if the size of <var>M</var>* is more than <var>M</var>, then this graph <var>G</var> contains at least <var>M</var>* minus <var>M</var>, M-augmenting paths. So, this lemma basically shows that if our matching <var>M</var> here is not optimal, then there do exist M-augmenting paths.</p>
<p>So, the first result showed us if we can find M-augmenting paths, then we can use them to find a bigger matching. The second lemma showed us that if the matching we have right now is not optimal, then such M-augmenting paths must exist.</p>
<p>So, by combining them, we can see that Here is the basic idea for finding the optimal matching. We know that if the matching we have right now is not optimal yet is not a maximum size yet, then think about the optimal matching.</p>
<p>Because the maximum size matching must be a bit better, bigger size than our matching. So then, by this lemma here, there must exist some M-augmenting paths in this graph. So we can try to find them. Once we find such m organ paths, which must exist, then we can use them to augment our matching to a bigger size.</p>
<p>Therefore, this gives us basically the idea of this algorithm here for finding a maximum matching. So, we can start with some matching and then try to find augmenting paths because the lemma here shows us the augmenting paths must exist. Once we find such augmenting paths, then we can use the result, the idea in the first result here, to augment the match into a bigger size.</p>
<p>We can keep doing this until there are no more augmenting paths left. And when that is true, we must have found a maximum matching. Therefore, we have this conclusion here. Matching <var>M</var> in graph <var>G</var> is a maximum matching if and only if <var>G</var> contains no M-augmented paths. So, the real choice here is...</p>
<p>And if and only if condition. So, the matching <var>M</var> is a maximum size if and only if there are no more M-augmenting paths.</p>
<p>Therefore, to find an optimal matching, which is a matching of the maximum size, we can just keep looking for M-augmenting paths until no such path exists. So this is what we have learned from these concepts.</p>
